# Migration Agent Notes

This project uses a small set of agent tracking files to keep the web migration organized.

- `.agent/ROADMAP.md` tracks phases, scope, and tab-to-endpoint mapping.
- `.agent/STATUS.md` tracks current progress and next steps.
- `.agent/DECISIONS.md` records key technical decisions and rationale.

Update `STATUS.md` after each milestone and add entries to `DECISIONS.md` when a choice affects architecture, tooling, or data storage.
